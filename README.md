# uzumaki-store
Uzumaki Store, a full stack online clothing store complete with real credit checkout. Users can search, sell, add to cart and checkout their favourite items.
The application has six main models — Users, Items, Orders, CartItems, OrderItems, and Roles — all of which are relational and showcase the power of relational GraphQL Queries.The app also includes many server side bits including authentication, permissions, sending email, uploading images, and charging credit cards.
In addition to this ....i am also thinking of trying testing the react app....
